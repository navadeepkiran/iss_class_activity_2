Iam assigning line numbers starting from the first line to last and also not considering commens as lines only non commented lines are are counted
1.in line 1 defn of a function
 there is a missing column(:) after the def is_narc(n): this is syntax error
 2.in line 2 
 instead of == we should use = as we are assigning a value and not comparing them
 3. in line 3
 instead of == we should use = as we are assigning a valuse and comparing twovalues
 4.in line 4
 *** is used instead of ** as we want to generate a power
 x**y x^y
 there is no error in line 5 as it is a return value and it will be generated after comparing either 1 or 0
 5.
 in line 6
 column: is missing after function thing same as error 1
 in line 8 
 in the function call the function name is written wrong it has to be is_narc but some other thing is written
 in line 10
 again the function call is wrong as we shouold call 
 print_narcis_numbers(start end) but wrong thing is called
